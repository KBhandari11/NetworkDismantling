# NetworkDismantling

The nontrivial topology and intricate dynamics of complex systems allow certain critical nodes to bear importance among other nodes for network robustness[9]. The effects of targeted attacks on such critical nodes are significant enough to make irreversible changes in the system. Finding such critical nodes is crucial to make, or avoid irreversible changes in the system depending upon its applications. For example, a targeted attack on certain servers could collapse an entire network, perturbations in the food web network could make an irreversible impact, or finding key drug dealers to dismantle a drug network. Such critical nodes in a complex network can help quantify the fragility of a complex network and its susceptibility to attacks.
However, finding such critical nodes in a complex network is an NP-Hard problem[7]. In this project, we used a machine learning model to approximately identify the optimal set of nodes such that its removal can efficiently collapse a complex network.
